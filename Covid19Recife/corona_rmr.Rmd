# Covid-19 cases in Recife Health Administrative Region

The data was collected up to October 29th, 2020, from [Wesley Cota Covid19 Github Repository](https://github.com/wcota/covid19br). The circles show how high is the rate of total cases per 100K inhabitants in each city. More information about cases in each marker. The source code is in this [repository](https://github.com/FilipeLima/DevelopingDataProducts/tree/main/Covid19Recife).
